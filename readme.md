Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

Overview:
This project focuses on developing a fraud detection system for credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify and flag potentially fraudulent transactions to enhance the security of financial transactions.

Project Structure:
- data: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- src: Python source code for the fraud detection model.
- models: Saved models or model checkpoints.

Data:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of credit card transactions with labeled classes indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

Model:
Logistic Regression Model of Machine Learning
